# Market-Penetration-and-Sales-Analysis

Project Description:

In this Python data analyst project, we start by cleaning our data, which involves several crucial tasks:

1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Removing rows containing NaN (null) values from the DataFrame.
   - Eliminating rows based on specific conditions.
   - Converting column types (e.g., to_numeric, to_datetime, astype) for consistency.

Once our data is cleaned and ready, we transition to the data exploration phase. In this section, we address five key business questions related to our dataset:

2. **Data Exploration:**
   - Determining the best-performing month for sales and calculating the earnings for that month.
   - Identifying the city that recorded the highest product sales.
   - Analyzing the optimal timing for displaying advertisements to boost customer purchases.
   - Investigating product pairs that are frequently sold together.
   - Determining the top-selling product and exploring factors contributing to its success.

To answer these questions, we employ various pandas and matplotlib methods, including:

3. **Data Analysis Techniques:**
   - Creating new columns to enrich the dataset.
   - Parsing cell values as strings to derive new information (using `.str` methods).
   - Applying functions to manipulate data effectively (using `.apply()`).
   - Utilizing the `groupby` method for aggregate analysis.
   - Visualizing results through bar charts and line graphs using Matplotlib.
   - Adding meaningful labels to our graphs for clarity.

This project provides a comprehensive overview of the data analysis process, from data cleaning to answering essential business questions using Python's powerful pandas and Matplotlib libraries. Explore our findings and methodologies to gain valuable insights from this dataset.
